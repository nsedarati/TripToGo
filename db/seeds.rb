# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# 20.times do
#   name = Faker::Company.name 
#   review = Faker::Lorem.paragraph(2, true)
#   address = Faker::Address.street_address
  

#   Hotel.create(name: name, review: review, address: address)
# end

# hotels = Hotel.create([{name: "Hilton"}, {name: 'Shangri La'}, {name: 'Grand Hayat'}, {name: 'Ibis'}])
